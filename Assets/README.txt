Hello, and welcome to the unity thingy. This was set up by Panzer.

As of the moment it's pretty much a free for all, feel free to make a branch on github and experiment with stuff. When you're comfortable sharing it please make a pull request.
I've barely used GitHub so I'm largely talking out of my ass. I would have used the Unity version control but it costs money and requires a business address.
