# TacticallyComfy3DTuberApp

Hello fellow Tactically Comfy dev members! I am Panzer, and I have created this repo so that we can share code! I had to pay $5 to host it because it's too fucking big!


Right now the project is basically a free for all. Make a new local branch on your machine and use Unity version 2021.3.27f1 LTS to edit it.

Some basic commands (in cmd or git bash):
	git status - checks if there are unadded files to the local repo
	git add . - adds all files to the local repo (takes a bit if theres a lot of files)
	git pull - updates the local branch with the commits from cloud, and update all remote branches. 
	git push - update the cloud so your code can be shared
	git checkout -b [branchname] - this makes a new branch from your current commit and sets it to your working branch.
	git push -u origin [branchname] - updates the specific cloud branch that you are checked out to.
	
To be honest, no fucking clue. There is a desktop app that probably makes it easier. I haven't really used it yet so I don't know what makes mistakes and what doesn't.
